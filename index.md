# Introduction
The Threat and Safeguard Matrix or (TaSM) is an action oriented view to safeguard and enable the business created by Ross Young.  It started with a thought that we often list our greatest threats to our company in a risk register, but fail to actually provide a defense in depth plan that actually works.  Simply put if Cyber is in the business of Revenue Protection we need to have a well though out plan against the biggest threats to our company.
