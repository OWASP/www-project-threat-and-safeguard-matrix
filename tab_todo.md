# Things To Do

- Speak at Conferences such as RSA to share the Matrix
- Create tailored mappings for Mobile Application Threats and Safeguards
- Create tailored mappings for the greatest attack threats shown by CISA
[RISK VULNERABILITY AND ASSESSMENT (RVA) MAPPED TO THE MITRE ATT&CKÂ® FRAMEWORK](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Risk%20and%20Vulnerability%20Assessment%20%28RVA%29%20Mapped%20to%20the%20MITRE%20ATT%26amp%3BCK%20Framework%20Infographic_v6-100620_%20508.pdf)
- Add in additional fields of complexity like what we see in the Austrailian work here [Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents](https://www.cyber.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-03/PROTECT%20-%20Strategies%20to%20Mitigate%20Cyber%20Security%20Incidents%20%28February%202017%29.pdf)
- Map Risk-Reduction ROI calculations [Risk-Reduction ROI](https://www.cisecurity.org/blog/the-one-equation-you-need-to-calculate-risk-reduction-roi/)
- Consider using [5 Top Cyber Threats from Verizon DBIR] (https://www.cisecurity.org/blog/protecting-organizations-from-todays-top-cyber-threats/). This would allow better mapping to the [CIS Community Defense Model](https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/cis-community-defense-model/)
- Look at the CIS Community Defense Model for the specific security value of safeguards [CIS Community Defense Model](https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/cis-community-defense-model/)
